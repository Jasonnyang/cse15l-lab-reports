## Week 4 lab report
1. Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account<br>
I ran the command ```rm -rf lab7``` to delete the lab7 folder. Then I deleted any forks of the repository that I had on my account on Github. <br>

I pressed the fork button on the top right of the screen which took me to this page. I pressed the green create fork button in order to fork the repository. <br>

I logged into ieng6 by typing ```ssh cs15lwi23anc@ieng6.ucsd.edu```. Because I ran the command earlier that day, I was able to type ```<up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>``` to save some typing. <br>

I ran the command ```git clone git@github.com:Jasonnyang/lab7.git``` in order to clone. I got the url by going to my forked repository and clicking ssh and copying the url, shown in the image below.
