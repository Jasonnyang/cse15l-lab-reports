The HandleRequest method is called in this screenshot. The method needs a URI and it also needs a path, for example "/add-message?s=Hello" in order to know what text to append to the list. The arraylist called arr in the code changes based on how many times a message has been added. The method's url parameter is changed every time to reflect what url and query string the code should process, in this case "Hello". The string str is also changed because right now there is only Hello and a new line character. <br>

**Part 2** <br>
```java
class EvensExample {
  static int sumEvenIndices(int[] nums) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
      sum += nums[i + 1];
    }
    return sum;
  }
}
```
A failure-inducing input for the buggy program
```java
public void testSumEvensLength4() {
    int[] input1 = { 12, 13, 7, 2};
    assertEquals(EvensExample.sumEvenIndices(input1), 19);
}
```
An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure
```java
public void testSumEvenLength6() {
    int[] input1 = { 12, 13, 7, 8, 5, 3};
    assertEquals(EvensExample.sumEvenIndices(input1), 24);
}
```
The symptom, as the output of running the tests<br>
The program is summing all of the odd indexes instead of the even indexes

The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it
```java
class EvensExample {
  static int sumEvenIndices(int[] nums) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
      sum += nums[i + 1];
    }
    return sum;
  }
}
```
```java
class EvensExample {
  static int sumEvenIndices(int[] nums) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
      sum += nums[i];
    }
    return sum;
  }
}
```
This fix addresses the issue because originally we were adding 1 to all of the indexes being summed so index 1, 3, 5, etc. were being summed instead of 0, 2, 4, etc. By removing the [i+1] and replacing it with [i] it allows the even indexes to be summed instead of the odd ones. <br>
